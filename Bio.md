- 👋 Hi, I’m Haris Moin, with my tech name as @iMPactCoder on most Developement platforms that I am a part of.

- 👀 I’m interested in Lots of Stuff, ranging from Web Developement to Cybersecurity, to Machine Learning and its implementation in Artificial Intelligece,
     I also like Data Science and Data Analysis for its great need in Industries and Businesses used in making cruical decisions. However, my main work revolves
     around web developement using Django and sometimes Flask, also I have a decent knowledge about frontend web developement so that comes in handy along the way.
     I also solve coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank and Codechef. In my meantime I like to jam alone with my Guitar and make some good vocal
     videos. Other than all this I do manage to take out time to play basketball with my friends.
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development, App Developement, and hopefully in the near future I shall work my way around full DevOps process with these. Other 
      than web developement I am learning Basics of Linux OS, Data Manipulation and analysis using different Python modules namely Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy etc,
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Frontend and Backend Web projects using Django.
